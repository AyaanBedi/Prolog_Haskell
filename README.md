# Prolog_Haskell
This project aims to implement first-order logic aspect of Prolog in Haskell. Prolog is a logic programming language that uses declarative programming by declaring a set of facts and rules to define relations. Whereas, Haskell is a purely functional language. By doing so, we try to provide a functional approach to logic programming.
